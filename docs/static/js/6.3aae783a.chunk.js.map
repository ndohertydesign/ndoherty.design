The heavier weight of these\n              lines that first brings your eye to the area combined with the\n              angles make it look like the perspective of looking up at a\n              building. It's also interesting with how the lines are not\n              perfectly lined up to one another in some cases, and how some of\n              the squares are missing from the grid like structure. It adds some\n              depth to these lines themselves instead of just having them as a\n              tool to move the viewer's eyes upwards towards the flower lines.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"paragraph-font\">\n              The flower lines themselves also are well put together and placed.\n              There is a little bit of tension on the right side that reinforces\n              the idea that this grid structure is supposed to move you to this\n              area of the composition. Overall it's a very well balanced\n              composition and highlights the differences in the types of lines\n              quite well.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        <br />\n        <Row>\n          <Col className=\"sticky-col p-3 flex-center-content\" sm={12} md={7}>\n            <Image\n              fluid\n              style={{ maxWidth: \"50%\" }}\n              src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/ndohertydesign/blog-media/line-critique-2_LFSbYihVg.png\"\n            />\n          </Col>\n          <Col className=\"p-3 scrolling-col\" xs={12} md={5}>\n            <p className=\"paragraph-font\">\n              For this line composition, I feel that these two elements could\n              have been placed together better than its current state. The lines\n              from the tower bring my eyes directly upwards like the last\n              composition, but there is not as much of a reinforcement that the\n              next thing I should jump to is the flower lines. It feels a little\n              far away, or that the tower lines almost point in the wrong\n              direction, not at the flowers.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"paragraph-font\">\n              Maybe moving the tower closer or even into the flower would help\n              to reinforce this direction in the composotion, as well as remove\n              some of the extra space in the composition. Another idea is to\n              maybe replicate the flower lines with smaller flowers getting\n              bigger as they move up along the tower in the composition,\n              reinforcing the direction of the tower while also having the\n              flower elements closer to the tower focal point to make the jump\n              between the two types of elements easier.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </BlogPost>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nexport default class BlogPost extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"my-5\">\n        <Row>\n          <Col>\n            <h1 className=\"header-font mb-0\">{this.props.title}</h1>\n            <p className=\"paragraph-font\">{this.props.date}</p>\n            <br />\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
