In the beginning of this line module I was very lost, I didn't really understand how to build a full abstract composition using just lines. After watching the Gestalt and hierarchy lectures I had a much better understanding, but still not fully. When creating the first three compositions with the rectilinear lines I had a much better time creating visual heirarchy and visual groups using these principles. But I really struggled when it came to the last drawing that had to represent a song. I was focused too much on the lines themselves and making sure I added all of them on the page and not as concerned with how they interacted with one another within the composition. My drawing for the song feels all over the place, and that there isn't really a main focal point. I would argue that it still has a okay visual hierarchy, but it is definitely confusing to move from one to another. I could have composed it much better with using the bolded vocal line as a main focal point instead of an entry point as well as put less emphasis and size on some of the lines that represent background instruments. I feel that I also could have come at it with more of an idea what about the song I wanted to capture. This was reinforced after seeing other's song compositions which usually had a clear goal or idea to show about the song. I feel I was too concerned with just trying to translate the instruments into lines and making sure that they are all there.")}},83:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return u}));var n=a(7),i=a(8),s=a(10),o=a(9),r=a(0),l=a.n(r),h=a(79),c=a(80),u=function(e){Object(s.a)(a,e);var t=Object(o.a)(a);function a(){return Object(n.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(i.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return l.a.createElement("div",{className:"my-5"},l.a.createElement(h.a,null,l.a.createElement(c.a,null,l.a.createElement("h1",{className:"header-font mb-0"},this.props.title),l.a.createElement("p",{className:"paragraph-font"},this.props.date),l.a.createElement("br",null))),this.props.children)}}]),a}(r.Component)}}]);
