Basically how different types of shapes & lines interact with the other elements in the composition to create action and movement or harmony. When working on my compositons I was heavily focused on the directions that the shapes moved your eyes, the balance of the whole composition, and symmetry or lack of. Tension and the interaction of the different shapes was not on my mind as much. I also learned a bit more about spacing and what it can actually mean for a composition, like giving the subject some more breathing room, or placing elements closer together to show that the viewer should read them as one.")}},126:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,"a",(function(){return m}));var a=n(9),o=n(10),i=n(12),r=n(11),s=n(0),c=n.n(s),h=n(122),l=n(123),m=function(e){Object(i.a)(n,e);var t=Object(r.a)(n);function n(){return Object(a.a)(this,n),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(o.a)(n,[{key:"render",value:function(){return c.a.createElement("div",{className:"my-5"},c.a.createElement(h.a,null,c.a.createElement(l.a,null,c.a.createElement("h1",{className:"header-font mb-0"},this.props.title),c.a.createElement("p",{className:"paragraph-font"},this.props.date),c.a.createElement("br",null))),this.props.children)}}]),n}(s.Component)}}]);
