Most feedback in this step was suggestions on features to add, and what should be changed within the existing user interface. The second step was for us to send all the tester a reminder notification. We did this through a messaging service, since not all testers had the app on their phone. We tested two styles, one that required a confirmation, and one that did not. The style of reminder didn't seem to have any effect on those who showed up. The third step of the experience testing was actually participating in the event. This was the weak point of the testing, as we don't set up the activities, the organizations would.
