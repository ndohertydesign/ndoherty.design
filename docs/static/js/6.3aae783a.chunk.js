The heavier weight of these lines that first brings your eye to the area combined with the angles make it look like the perspective of looking up at a building. It's also interesting with how the lines are not perfectly lined up to one another in some cases, and how some of the squares are missing from the grid like structure. It adds some depth to these lines themselves instead of just having them as a tool to move the viewer's eyes upwards towards the flower lines."),l.a.createElement("p",{className:"paragraph-font"},"The flower lines themselves also are well put together and placed.
