It feels a little\n              misleading to look at. I started with my eyes on the bridge and\n              followed the path towards the top of the photo, only to find that\n              there isn't much to look at back there. Once I realized that I\n              came back to the bridge and noticed the arrow pointing towards the\n              bottom of the image. This confused me a little bit because it\n              directs my eyes to the bottom, but there isn't really anything to\n              look at there. I'm not sure what was behind you when taking this\n              photo, but maybe incorporating that arrow into the shot in the\n              other direction to move the viewer's eye to a different focal\n              point could have been a good choice of the composition with the\n              path, bridge, and arrow in this area.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"paragraph-font\">\n              Another thing that I noticed and thought of is that when taking\n              this photo, one thing you maybe could have done was taken it from\n              a lower angle to add more space in the photo using the sky. This\n              way you can frame the bridge focal point easier, and still use the\n              path / arrow to direct the viewer's attention. Right now it feels\n              very full with the rocks, water, and the treeline along the path\n              in the distance of the composition. I think it adds some extra\n              details and areas in the photo that grab your eyes and move you\n              away from the bridge. I find myself almost trying to focus on the\n              treeline more because it is cut off. I think the water is a good\n              addition to have in the photo as well, the texture of it adds a\n              lot to the photo and it reinforces that the focus is the bridge,\n              maybe you could have included more of that in the photo as well.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </BlogPost>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nexport default class BlogPost extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"my-5\">\n        <Row>\n          <Col>\n            <h1 className=\"header-font mb-0\">{this.props.title}</h1>\n            <p className=\"paragraph-font\">{this.props.date}</p>\n            <br />\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
