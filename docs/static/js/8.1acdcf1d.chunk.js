I for sure start at the star in the top right, but the hierarchy of what I move to next is a little vague. I think that it would be the waterfall looking lines, but I cold also argue that the lines in the bottom right are bolded enough to jump to next. Maybe thinning them out a little could help with the hierarchy of the composition as a whole. But overall, the focal and entry point of the star, the waterfall going down, and the other lines pointing to the bottom left set a really clear direction and path for the composition of these elements. The star itself even mainly points in that same direction by cutting off the corners that point in the other direction."),h.a.createElement("p",{className:"paragraph-font"},"While the direction in this piece is really good, I feel that you could have used shape properties a little bit better in this. For example when I mention that the star already points in the same direction of the overall direction, maybe you could have another shape to point downwards and have used that in the waterfall to really enforce the downwards motion. Another thing that you could have played with is using more organic shapes in this composition to contrast the sharpness of the star. It would fit on the side of the waterfall where you used the curvy lines, and almost create a half organic, half rectilinear composition with some interesting balance. Right now the visuals are dominated by this star, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I feel that you may have been able to balance it better by using more shapes instead of lines."))))}}]),a}(s.Component)},54:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return u}));var n=a(4),i=a(5),o=a(7),r=a(6),s=a(0),h=a.n(s),l=a(50),c=a(51),u=function(e){Object(o.a)(a,e);var t=Object(r.a)(a);function a(){return Object(n.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(i.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return h.a.createElement("div",{className:"my-5"},h.a.createElement(l.a,null,h.a.createElement(c.a,null,h.a.createElement("h1",{className:"header-font mb-0"},this.props.title),h.a.createElement("p",{className:"paragraph-font"},this.props.date),h.a.createElement("br",null))),this.props.children)}}]),a}(s.Component)}}]);
