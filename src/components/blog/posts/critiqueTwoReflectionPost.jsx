    <BlogPost title="Critique 2 Reflection: Line" date="07/14/20">
      I learned a lot in this critique. In the beginning of this line module I
      was very lost, I didn't really understand how to build a full abstract
      composition using just lines. After watching the Gestalt and hierarchy
      lectures I had a much better understanding, but still not fully. When
      creating the first three compositions with the rectilinear lines I had a
      much better time creating visual heirarchy and visual groups using these
      principles. But I really struggled when it came to the last drawing that
      had to represent a song. I was focused too much on the lines themselves
      and making sure I added all of them on the page and not as concerned with
      how they interacted with one another within the composition. My drawing
      for the song feels all over the place, and that there isn't really a main
      focal point. I would argue that it still has a okay visual hierarchy, but
      it is definitely confusing to move from one to another. I could have
      composed it much better with using the bolded vocal line as a main focal
      point instead of an entry point as well as put less emphasis and size on
      some of the lines that represent background instruments. I feel that I
      also could have come at it with more of an idea what about the song I
      wanted to capture. This was reinforced after seeing other's song
      compositions which usually had a clear goal or idea to show about the
      song. I feel I was too concerned with just trying to translate the
      instruments into lines and making sure that they are all there.
