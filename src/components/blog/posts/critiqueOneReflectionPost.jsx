      In this critique I learned a lot about the creation of tension versus
      harmony in compositions. Basically how different types of shapes & lines
      interact with the other elements in the composition to create action and
      movement or harmony. When working on my compositons I was heavily focused
      on the directions that the shapes moved your eyes, the balance of the
      whole composition, and symmetry or lack of. Tension and the interaction of
      the different shapes was not on my mind as much. I also learned a bit more
      about spacing and what it can actually mean for a composition, like giving
      the subject some more breathing room, or placing elements closer together
      to show that the viewer should read them as one.
